        I earned my B.Sc. in Mechatronics from **Università degli Studi di Padova** :it: in 2015 and subsequently my M.Sc. in Robotics in 2017 after attending the EMARO+ (European Master in Advanced Robotics) program - a double-degree jointly delivered by **Università di Genova** :it: and **Centrale Nantes** :fr:
      </p>
      <p markdown="1">
        From 2017 to 2020, I worked at **Laboratorie des Sciences du Numérique de Nantes (LS2N)** :fr: on my PhD thesis entitled *"Dynamic Visual Servoing for Fast Robotic Arms"*, under the supervision of Philippe Martinet and Olivier Kermorgant.

        After getting my doctorate, I moved to Nice where I worked for the **Université Côte d'Azur** :fr: on a post-doctoral research focused on a special type of Model-Predictive-Control. Later, I turned to an ATER (teaching & research) contract at the same university, juxtaposing my research with teaching different disciplines such as C Programming, Linear Algebra and Reinforcement Learning.

        In my free time, I enjoy engaging in outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing and scuba-diving. I am also an amateur landscape photographer --- I love documenting the places I visit on my adventures with my Sony camera!
