As soon as I have some time, I will fill in this page explaining what I have
done to create this website using Jekyll and GitHub pages!

The website was built using Jekyll, which, in a nutshell, allows to generate
static pages from markdown content. To get started, it is sufficient to follow
the steps detailed in [Jekyll's website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/),
after which the PC will be equipped with all the tools needed to generate a
static website. I haven't tested the same under Windows/Mac, however it should
be fairly simple to accomplish the same in any other OS.

  While performing the last step of the installation guide - executing the
  command `gem install jekyll bundler` - I encountered an error related to
  the connection being timed out. Although I do not entirely understand the
  issue, the solution (obviously found somewhere in a StackOverflow post!)
  was rather easy and consisted in temporarily disabling IPv6 in the
  network settings.

**THE POST IS NOT COMPLETED YET! SORRY...**

I will try to complete it soon :)

  This is an example dummy text that I need simply to test the framed boxes.
  It does not need to really make sense, in fact foo bar baz and "Lorem ipsum
  dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur suscipit erat a nisi
  facilisis sollicitudin. Suspendisse pretium consectetur maximus."
